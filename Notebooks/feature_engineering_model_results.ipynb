    "Feature engineering is an important step in machine learning because it helps the model learn patterns that are not obvious in the raw data. By creating new features or modifying existing ones, we can give the model more useful information and often improve its prediction performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example in this project is the Total Capital Feature, which combines capital gains, capital losses, and dividends into a single value. This new feature represents a person’s overall financial activity more clearly than the three separate columns. During the analysis, I noticed that when capital_total is above around 20k, more than 85% of these records belong to people earning more than 50K per year. This shows that the combined feature is strongly linked to higher income and can help the model better identify the minority class (income > 50K). Improving this part of the prediction is especially useful for metrics like recall, which is important when the positive class is much smaller than the negative one. (more detail on this later)\n",

For tree-based models such as RandomForest, XGBoost, or CatBoost, no scaling is needed since trees rely on threshold-based splits.

Because their distribution is irregular but not heavily long-tailed, applying a log-transform would distort the mass of zeroes and is therefore not suitable. For tree-based models, these variables are kept as-is and for linear models, we apply a StandardScaler to ensure numerical stability. (same as age)\n",

For tree-based models, the log-transform alone is sufficient. For linear or SVM models, we apply log-transform followed by StandardScaler, ensuring both distribution correction and scale normalization. "

    "To define the right feature strategy, I first needed a clear pipeline. Before looking at detailed statistics such as the number of unique values or category proportions, I started with a more high-level, logical approach. I firstly, check whether some categorical features are likely to affect income at all, based on a general understanding of the problem and logic. Other steps involved indentifying redundant information across columns that essentially describe the same concept and inspecting missing values and/or imbalance to decide how to handle or drop them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final list of selected features (shown below) is the result of an iterative, trial-and-error process. Some categories and variables were kept, transformed, or discarded based on how they affected model performance. The detailed results and evaluation metrics are presented in a later section.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) **Problem Understanding Logic:** \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the column reason_for_unemployment was discarded. We already know from other variables whether a person is employed full-time, part-time, or unemployed. The specific reason for being unemployed (e.g., job loss vs. leaving voluntarily) does not meaningfully affect income in this dataset. In both cases, the outcome is the same: the person is not currently earning wages. Keeping this column therefore adds little value and introduces unnecessary noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature removed for similar reasons is live_in_this_house_1_year_ago. Intuitively, whether someone lived in the same house a year ago does not strongly relate to their income level. The data supports this intuition: the income distribution across the categories “Yes,” “No,” and “Not in universe” is very similar, with no meaningful separation between high- and low-income groups. In addition, more than half of the rows fall under “Not in universe under 1 year old”, a category that remains unclear even after checking the documentation (see below). Removing this feature slightly improved model performance.\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "b) **Redundancuy of information** :\n",
    "\n",
    "Some features provide very similar information, which adds noise and redundancy. Highly overlapping variables can hurt model performance because they introduce unnecessary correlation or overly fine-grained categories. A clear example is the pair major_industry_code and detailed_industry_recode. Both describe the person’s industry but at different levels of detail (24 vs. 52 unique values). Through trial and error, the more detailed version produced better results, so the broader one was removed. The same logic applied to the occupation variables. Another example is hispanic_origin. Since we already have the race column, which includes Hispanic/Latino categories, keeping both features created redundant information. Removing hispanic_origin led to a slight improvement in performance. The dataset also includes two similar household-related variables describing family and household structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) **Missing/Imbalanced Categories**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The final reason for dropping certain features was the presence of missing or highly imbalanced categories. Several columns contained \"?\" in more than 50% of their entries (for example, the migration-related features such as migration_code_* and migration_prev_res_in_sunbelt). Since \"?\" has no clear meaning and we cannot reliably interpret what it represents, keeping these columns would only introduce noise and make the model less reliable. Removing them helps maintain full control over the data fed into the model and improves performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I do not list every dropped category individually, but all removed features fall under one of the three conditions described above."

    "Based on the remaining features, the next step was to encode the categorical columns using two methods: OneHotEncoder and Target Encoding. OneHotEncoder is suited for low-cardinality features because it creates a separate binary column for each category, which works well when the number of unique values is small. In contrast, Target Encoding is more appropriate for high-cardinality features, as it replaces each category with the average target value instead of generating many new columns, helping reduce dimensionality and avoid unnecessary complexity. Through iterative testing, I set a threshold where columns with fewer than **10** unique categories were encoded using OneHotEncoder, while those above the threshld used Target Encoding, which provided the best overall model performance."

    "To reduce noise and make features easier for the model to learn from, it is often useful to **bin or group** categories. However, this comes with a trade-off: too much grouping removes useful information and reduces the natural detail of the data. In this case, I tested grouping for the high-frequency categorical features (above 10 unique values), but the performance became worse. Since model training time was not a constraint, I decided to keep the full granularity for these features and avoid binning, as preserving the original categories produced better results, and therefore only did the binning on the low-frequency categorical features"

    "Even though the accuracy is high (around 95%) - similar to the performance model  C4.5 (4.8% error rate) - , this metric is misleading because simply predicting the majority class (income ≤50K) already yields about 93% accuracy due to the strong class imbalance. For this reason, the focus should be on the minority class (income >50K). In particular, recall for the positive class is more important than precision in this context. Recall measures the proportion of true high-income individuals correctly identified by the model and is defined as:\n",

    "A low recall means many actual high-income individuals are misclassified as low-income (false negatives). Since the goal is to understand which characteristics are associated with earning above 50K, missing these individuals would severely limit the insights the model can provide. Precision is still relevant, but false positives are less harmful here than false negatives. Therefore, the evaluation focuses primarily on recall and also considers F1-score, which balances both precision and recall."

    "With XGBoost, we observe a clear improvement compared to the default model (unlike Random Forest). The recall for the minority class increased from 0.50 to 0.72, although this comes with a drop in precision. This trade-off is intentional, as I decided that the goal in this project is to prioritize recall for the minority class, as explained earlier. In addition, XGBoost trained roughly five times faster than Random Forest using the same number of folds. In our context, XGBoost clearly outperforms Random Forest across three important criteria: \n",

    "Throughout the entire model evaluation, we used the default classification threshold of 0.5. In a binary classification setting, this threshold means that if the predicted probability of the positive class (income >50K) is greater than 0.5, the model assigns the label 1; otherwise, it assigns 0. In other words, the threshold controls how confident the model must be before predicting someone as high-income.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practice to adjust this threshold and evaluate the model’s performance across different values between 0 and 1, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. In real applications, the optimal threshold depends on the client’s priorities. In this project, I aimed to maximize the **F1-score** while ensuring that **recall remained higher than precision**, consistent with the earlier decision to prioritize capturing as many true high-income individuals as possible. If prioritizing recall above precision, then an F-2 score would have been relevant (recall is weighted twice as much)."

    "Now that we have selected the best-performing machine learning model, tuned its hyperparameters, and identified the optimal threshold for maximizing the minority-class F1-score, we can move to the final evaluation step. Up to this point, all model fitting and threshold optimization were performed using the training and validation sets only. To ensure that our final performance estimate is completely unbiased and that no data leakage occurred during model development, we now evaluate the model on the test set, which has remained unseen throughout the entire process.\n",

Even though the threshold was chosen to maximize the F1-score, recall remains higher than precision, which reflects the modeling objective: prioritizing the correct identification of positive cases (income >50K), even at the cost of increasing false positives (predicting low-income individuals as high-income)."

    "Finally, one final key aspect to englobe a model success or not is the confusion Matrix. It shows that the model performs well on both classes. The top-left value (53,360) is high, which is expected because the negative class is the majority. More importantly, the bottom-right value (2,338) is the second-largest cell, which means the model correctly identifies a good number of high-income individuals. The bottom-left value (1,376) represents the false negatives, and although this number is not small, it is reasonable given the class imbalance and the fact that we intentionally increased recall. Overall, the matrix confirms that the model captures many of the true high-income cases while keeping errors at an acceptable level."

    "A crucial model performance evaluation lies in understanding which features impacts the most wheter a person is or not above the 50k threhsold per annum. The features are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tax_Filler_Status** (Class 0 -> Non Filler) : The strongest feature which is fairly self-explanatory seems totallu logic as in most case where a person does not file tax tend have lower or unstable income, truly seperating both classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Detail_Summary_HouseHold** (Class 0 -> Child under 18) : Once again a strong feature that goes towards classifiyiong easily if a person is within class 0 is if he is a child (to some exceptions of course) \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Capital_Total** (Class 1) : The numerical column we created during the feature engineering part did come out to be very helpful, as it helped the model idenitfing person who have more than 50k per year (getting a better importance score than `capital_losses` or `capital_gains`), which highlights the importance of feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sex** (both Classes): This variable contributes meaningfully to the prediction. This aligns with the wage differences observed in the EDA and with real-world income patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the model relies on a combination of demographics (sex, age, marital status), economic indicators (capital gains/losses), employment characteristics (occupation, weeks worked), and household information. These features align well with the factors that logically distinguish higher-income individuals."
